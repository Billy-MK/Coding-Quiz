# Coding-Quiz

## Description

This project was intended to exercise our ability to code in Javascript and use jQuery to create a dynamic webpage.

The coding quiz consists of a series of questions and answers, along with a timer that reduces by ten seconds when the user inputs an incorrect response.

This assignment allowed me to practice creating a very dynamic webpage, and highlighted the usefulness of jQuery. 

This project would have been made much easier with more knowledge of back-end development. As it is, this quiz can be very easily "hacked" to identify the correct answers by simply looking at the HTML code.

There is no way to compare scores between different users without knowledge of back-end development. For this reason, the quiz only tracks the local user's score.
